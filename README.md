# World_Weather_Analysis
#### Weather analysis and travel recommendation with maps and directions of +600 cities around the World.  


## Overview 
The goal of this project was to retrieve weather data using OpenWeather API to then help PlanMyTrip Co. create a customer travel destination map with more than 600 cities. Moreover, I used the Google Maps API to come up with one hotel recommendation for each city. And lastly, I created a travel itinerary map where I chose 4 neighboor cities to come up with a full travel and directions guide.
